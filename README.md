# Simple-Face-Detection

## General Info
A Simple Face Detection Python Script using the haarcascade classifiers from the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)library<br>
This script is used to detect whether there is a face/faces in an image and print the image/s name.<br>
In order to test the 'face_recognition.py' script I added a directory named 'images', where it contains images with or <br>
without faces.

**Usage**

```
$python3 face_recognition.py
```
